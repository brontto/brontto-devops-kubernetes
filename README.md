#### 3.06 DBaaS vs DIY
##### DBaaS
###### Pros
- fast and easy setup
- easy to scale
- reliable and works well with gke
###### Cons
- cost 
- migration to something else can be difficult

##### DIY
###### Pros
- own is own and you can do whatever you want with it
- can be cheaper
###### Cons
- configuration is always harder and you need better knowledge about security and stuff
- needs maintenance

#### 3.07 Commitment
I already used DIY mongodb in my project cause the document database seems like an easier option for me.
